## Introduction

Competitive balance
a.	Desire for uncertainty of outcome
i.	Examples, introduction of new teams (find examples where new teams have performed well or poorly)
ii.	MLB (Blue Jays – est 1977 freq last), NBA, AFL (gold coast, GWS, but also WCE, Adelaide, Freo, Port – what about Hawks, Roos if go back far enough)
b.	Financial and other objectives
i.	membership, attendance
ii.	respect (within and outside the league)
iii.	Establish supporter base
c.	Assimilation
i.	Allow team to exhibit properties of other members as soon as possible (win:loss ratio, years to success) => team strength
(B)	Sport Reference Points (SRPs)
a.	Team strength (productivity) naturally leads to concepts of where you want a team to be, within a time frame.
b.	How provide players to new teams
i.	Draft, trading, concessions. Give examples (eg AFL, MLB)
c.	Reference points (introduce earlier?)
i.	What are they? Target, limit
ii.	Other fields, examples from fisheries, forestry, finance
iii.	Implicit in sport, eg priority draft picks in AFL, others in other sports?

Methods and Results
(A)	Target reference points (TRP)
a.	Example from AFL-like league
b.	Use Sports Synthesis Model
c.	Key is simulation and probabilistic framework
d.	Desire is to have the team strength ST larger than the target by time T with probability PT.  P(ST> Rtarg)> PT
e.	Also consider the time to being “equivalent”
f.	Note this example has a focus on the target reference point, Rtarg 
(B)	Limit reference points (LRP)
a.	Discussion of priority draft picks (PDPs) (no model runs?)
b.	Use example with (1) no PDPs (2) with PDPs
c.	Compare recovery to target (or by time tT  )
Discussion
(A)	Shown how reference points in sport can be used to improve management (competitive balance)
(B)	Use of stochastic models of the league (cannot be done with equilibrium models as these don’t capture the dynamic, stochastic behaviours)
(C)	Successfully applied in other fields
(D)	Other sports examples of where SRPs may be useful (draft penalties – another paper)
(E)	Limitations and issues of SRPs and modelling
